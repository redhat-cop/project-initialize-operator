========================================

[![Build Status](https://github.com/redhat-cop/project-initialize-operator/workflows/project-initialize-operator/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/redhat-cop/project-initialize-operator/actions?workflow=project-initialize-operator)
 [![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/redhat-cop/project-initialize-operator/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/redhat-cop/project-initialize-operator)

_This repository is currently undergoing active development. Functionality may be in flux_

## Overview

This repository contains the project initialize operator which provides functionality for creating new projects within OpenShift and triggering custom onboarding processes, specifically around the GitOps solution [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/).


## Install (OpenShift)

Run the following steps to run the operator locally. The operator will require `cluster-admin` permissions that can be applied using the resources provided in the deploy/ folder.

Prerequisites:

In order to run the operator locally, you will need to meet these [prerequisites](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk#prerequisites) and then follow these [instructions](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user/install-operator-sdk.md#install-the-operator-sdk-cli) to install the operator-sdk.

Create the expected namespace
```
$ oc new-project project-operator
```

Add projectinitialize crd and resources to cluster
```
$ oc apply -f deploy/service_account.yaml
$ oc apply -f deploy/role.yaml
$ oc apply -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
```

### Add ProjectInitialize CRD
#### 4.X OCP
```
$ oc apply -f deploy/crds/redhatcop.redhat.io_projectinitializes_crd.yaml
```
#### 3.X OCP
```
$ oc apply -f deploy/crds/redhatcop.redhat.io_projectinitializes_crd_3x.yaml
```

### Add ProjectInitialize CRD
#### 4.X OCP
```
$ oc apply -f deploy/crds/redhatcop.redhat.io_projectinitializequota_crd.yaml
```
#### 3.X OCP
```
$ oc apply -f deploy/crds/redhatcop.redhat.io_projectinitializequota_crd_3x.yaml
```
### Deploy Operator (OpenShift)
Run the following command when ready to deploy the operator into cluster it will monitor

```
$ oc apply -f deploy/operator.yaml
```

### Namespace Labels/Annotations
Labels and annotations can be added to the namespace that is generated through the operator by specifying the values within the `ProjectInitialize` CR.

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: ProjectInitialize
metadata:
  name: example-projectinitialize
spec:
  team: test
  env: dev
  cluster: clusterA
  displayName: "Test Project"
  desc: "A test project for showing the functionality of the project initialize operator"
  quotaSize: small
  namespaceDetails:
    annotations:
      testKey: testValue
    labels:
      testKey: testValue
```

### Adding Defined Quota Sizes to Cluster

When the `quotaSize` attribute is defined in the `ProjectInitializeQuota` Custom Resource (CR) the operator will search for a cluster level `ProjectInitializeQuota` CR that defines a praticular quota size. This can be used to define predetermined t-shirt sizes when creating new projects (small, medium, large, etc)

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: ProjectInitializeQuota
metadata:
  name: small
spec:
  hard:
    cpu: "5"
    memory: "10Gi"
    pods: "10"
```

## GitOps Integration
The creation of a namespace's GIT repository for [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) integration can be automated by including details about the GIT host and repository details.


| Property | Description | 
| --------- | ---------- |
| `provider` | The hosting provider platform for the GIT repositories (GitHub only option currenty)  |
| `private` | Is the newly created repository publicly available or private |
| `desc` | Description of the new repository |
| `owner` | The owner/organization of the GitHub account.
| `repo` | The name of the repository to use as a template |
| `accountSecret` | The secret name and namespace that contains the account token/credentials |


```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: ProjectInitialize
metadata:
  name: example-projectinitialize
spec:
  team: test
  env: dev
  cluster: clusterA
  displayName: "Test Project"
  desc: "A test project for showing the functionality of the project initialize operator"
  git:
    provider: GitHub
    private: false
    desc: "A test repo for showing the functionality of the project initialize operator"
    owner: <github-account-name>
    suffix: gitops
    accountSecret:
      name: github
      namespace: project-operator
```

### GIT Template
A Template is an optional property that can be provided as a basis of the contents of your initialized repository. This is handy if you want to include things like examples and links to documentation within the repository from the beginning.

```
  git:
    provider: GitHub
    private: false
    desc: "A test repo for showing the functionality of the project initialize operator"
    owner: <github-account-name>
    suffix: gitops
    accountSecret:
      name: github
      namespace: project-operator
  gitTemplate:
    owner: <github-account-name-of-template>
    repo: <repo-name-of-template>
```

## Example Workflow
The project initialize operator will need to be running in the project-operator namespace before running the following example workslow.


### Apply T-Shirt Size
First start by applying the `ProjectInitializeQuota` CR that will be a global t-shirt size placeholder that the  initializer can reference when applying quotas to new projects.
```
$ oc apply -f deploy/examples/small_projectqouta_cr.yaml
```

### Apply Project Initializer
Apply the `ProjectInitialize` CR which contains details about the dev team name, cluster name, and a reference to the `ProjectInitializeQuota` which will specify the quota to assign the namespace. 
```
$ oc apply -f deploy/examples/basic_projectinit_cr.yaml
```
